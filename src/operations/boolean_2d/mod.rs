//! 2D polygon boolean operations on [`PolygonWithHoles`] inputs.
//!
//! All operations share a single planar-arrangement engine (segment
//! split → vertex snap → bilateral half-edge classification →
//! polar-angle face walk → containment-matrix face assembly) and
//! differ only in the **fill oracle** that decides which result-region
//! a probe point lies in.
//!
//! # Operations
//!
//! | Function | Result region |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`union_all_with_holes`] | `⋃ inputs[i]` (OR-of-PWH-filled) |
//! | [`subtract_all_with_holes`] | `base ∩ (¬⋃ subtracts)` |
//!
//! Both return typed face topology (zero or more
//! [`PolygonWithHoles`]) where every output is guaranteed:
//! - CCW outer with `signed_area > 0`, CW holes with
//!   `signed_area < 0`.
//! - Every hole is fully contained in its outer.
//! - Sibling holes do not overlap.
//! - Boundaries are simple (no self-intersection).
//! - Outputs are CDT-safe (verified in `debug_assertions` builds).
//! - Determinism: outputs are topologically identical regardless of
//!   input order.
//!
//! # Adding a new operation
//!
//! 1. Implement [`engine::FillOracle`] for the new operation's fill
//!    rule.
//! 2. Add a public entry point that builds the segment-input list and
//!    calls [`engine::run_arrangement`] with the oracle.
//! 3. Add fixtures exercising the new fill rule.
